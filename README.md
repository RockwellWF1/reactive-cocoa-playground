# My ReactiveCocoa Playground
This is my playground for Reactive Cocoa stufs.

## Getting Started

Most of the external libraries uses CocoaPods. Some may use git submodules instead. Once you've cloned the repository, be sure to run `git submodule update --recursive --init` to pull all the submodules.

**Open `.xcworkspace` instead of the project file.**
